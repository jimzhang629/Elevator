# Rodent ELevator (RELevator) Maze

First, this:

## What applications does it have?

We propose an experimental paradigm utilizing a novel semi-autonomous control system, the RELevator, to determine hippocampal spatial representations of 3 dimensions. Specifically, we want to determine the role of hippocampal place cells in 3 dimensional representations, a difficult feat due to the brainâ€™s tendency to encode only necessary information to complete a task. We show how the RELevator provides a 3 dimensional task that cannot be completed with 2 dimensional encoding, differing from the majority of past studies and may present results countering those pre-existing. We also show how the proposed RELevator will account for inherent biases, producing spatial representation that rodents would innately form only when presented with a similarly dimensionally complex task in their natural environment, such as burrowing.

## A few notes about how to use it:

The RELevator allows the user access to 3 different levels on which they may present a rodent with tasks. According to its original intention, the RELevator was to provide level-dependent tasks to investigate the possibility of the existence of a vertically tuned place cell. However, it has come to our attention that the RELevator may provide a paradigm by which other inquires may be investigated, such as the effect of temporal delay on recall.
