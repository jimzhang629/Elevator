## What applications does it have?

We propose an experimental paradigm utilizing a novel semi-autonomous control system, the RELevator, to determine hippocampal spatial representations of 3 dimensions. Specifically, we want to determine the role of hippocampal place cells in 3 dimensional representations, a difficult feat due to the brainâ€™s tendency to encode only necessary information to complete a task. We show how the RELevator provides a 3 dimensional task that cannot be completed with 2 dimensional encoding, differing from the majority of past studies and may present results countering those pre-existing. We also show how the proposed RELevator will account for inherent biases, producing spatial representation that rodents would innately form only when presented with a similarly dimensionally complex task in their natural environment, such as burrowing.

## A few notes about how to use it:
